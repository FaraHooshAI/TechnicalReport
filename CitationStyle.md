## What is a citation and citation style?
A **citation** is a way of giving credit to individuals for their creative and intellectual works that you utilized to support your research. It can also be used to locate particular sources and combat plagiarism. Typically, a citation can include the author's name, date, location of the publishing company, journal title, or DOI (Digital Object Identifier).

A **citation style** dictates the information necessary for a citation and how the information is ordered, as well as punctuation and other formatting.
