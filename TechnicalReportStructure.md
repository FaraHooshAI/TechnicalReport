## Definition
A technical report is a formal report designed to convey technical information in a clear and easily accessible format. It is divided into sections which allow different readers to access different levels of information.

## Importance of Writing a Technical Report 
1. Efficient communication
2. Evidence for your work
3. Organizes the data
4. Tool for evaluation of your work

## How to Write a Technical Report?
When writing a technical report, there are two approaches you can follow, depending on what suits you the best.

### Top-down approach
In this, you structure the entire report from title to sub-sections and conclusion and then start putting in the matter in the respective chapters. This allows your thought process to have a defined flow and thus helps in time management as well.
### Evolutionary delivery
This approach is suitable if you’re someone who believes in ‘go with the flow’. Here the author writes and decides as and when the work progresses. This gives you a broad thinking horizon. You can even add and edit certain parts when some new idea or inspiration strikes.

## Structure
### Title
Must include the title of the report. Reports for assessment, where the word length has been specified, will often also require the summary word count and the main text word count. The name of the mentor or supervisor is also mentioned on this page.

### Summary(Abstract)
A summary of the whole report including important features, results and conclusions. It is written in such a manner that a person only reading the abstract can gain complete information on the project.

### Keywords
Normally 4 to 7 keywords

### Table of contents
Numbers and lists all section and subsection headings with page numbers. Each chapter and its subchapter is carefully divided into this section for easy navigation in the project.

If you’ve used a lot of graphs and tables, you need to create a separate content page for that. Each of these lists begins on a new page.

### Introduction
States the objectives of the report and comments on the way the topic of the report is to be treated. Leads straight into the report itself. It includes specifying the purpose, objectives of the project, the questions you have answered in your report, and sometimes an overview of the report is also provided. Note that your conclusion should answer the objective questions.

### The sections which make up the body of the report(Central Chapters)
Divided into numbered and headed sections. These sections separate the different main ideas in a logical order

### Conclusions
A short, logical summing up of the theme(s) developed in the main text

### References
Details of published sources of material referred to or quoted in the text (including any lecture notes and URL addresses of any websites used.

### Acknowledgements(optional)
List of people who helped you research or prepare the report, including your proofreaders.Appendices (if appropriate)
  
### Appendices (if appropriate)
Any further material which is essential for full understanding of your report (e.g. large scale diagrams, computer code, raw data, specifications) but not required by a casual reader.
